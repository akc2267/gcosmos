// Package tmdebug contains utilities useful for debugging components of Gordian's tm package tree.
//
// Most types have exported fields that must be set directly.
//
// None of the APIs in this package should be considered stable between versions of Gordian.
//
// Depending on what is being debugged, you may want to make changes to the
// exported types and methods in this package.
